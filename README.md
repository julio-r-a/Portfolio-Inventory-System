# Portfolio-Inventory-System
I am developing a system using Spring Boot with Java. The system includes a REST controller that interacts with a service layer, which implements transactional methods. Additionally, it has a data layer responsible for creating and managing entities using JPA and Hibernate. MySQL is used as the database management system. The service was packaged in a Docker container, facilitating its deployment and scalability.
